# Decision Tree Learning


## Overview

This project is meant to provide a simple command-line interface to train decision trees on data present in a CSV file, with options such as limiting the depth of the tree, among others that I hope to decide soon.

Currently, all that's available is a basic parser to parse CSV files and a type to represent a data set and basic functions to interact with the dataset - like creating it from a parsed CSV, printing it, etc.


# To do

- Work on `dtree.ml`.
- Make a REPL interface.
